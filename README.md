## VIRTUAL BEAUTY STUDIO
The Virtual Beauty Studio is a web-based application that allows users to try virtual makeup and hair enhancements in real time using a live camera feed. It applies digital effects such as lipstick, blush, eye shadow, and hair color by accurately tracking facial and hair regions, enabling instant preview and customization without physical application.

## About
Virtual Beauty Studio is a web-based application designed to provide users with a realistic virtual makeup and hair enhancement experience using a live camera feed. Traditional cosmetic trials are often time-consuming, unhygienic, and require physical product testing. This project overcomes these challenges by offering an interactive digital platform where users can virtually apply makeup effects such as lipstick, blush, eye shadow, and hair color in real time. By accurately detecting facial and hair regions, the system allows users to customize styles instantly and preview results without physical application, improving convenience, hygiene, and user confidence.

## Features
1) Real-time virtual makeup and hair enhancement using a live camera feed.
2) Accurate facial and hair region detection for realistic application.
3) Customizable options for lipstick, blush, eye shadow, and hair color with intensity control.
4) Browser-based implementation with no need for specialized hardware.
5) Supports before-and-after comparison and image capture for preview.

## Requirements
1) Operating System:
Requires a 64-bit operating system such as Windows 10/11 or Ubuntu/Linux for smooth execution and browser compatibility.

2) Development Environment:
HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development, with basic web server support (local or hosted).

3) Computer Vision Framework:
MediaPipe Face Mesh for real-time facial landmark detection and tracking (468 landmarks).

4) Image Processing Libraries:
OpenCV (optional, if backend processing is used) for image handling and enhancement operations.

5) Web Technologies:
Canvas API and WebRTC for real-time camera access, rendering, and overlaying virtual makeup effects.

6) Version Control:
Git for source code management, collaboration, and version tracking.

7) IDE / Tools:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for coding, debugging, and project management.
